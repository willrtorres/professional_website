  ### I design and build awesome data science products.
  My passion is researching and seeing what makes businesses tick. But, when I am not working, I enjoy flying my drones, reading books, and 
  playing Overwatch. 
  
  
  My area of focus is applying data science to business. I create value for companies by understanding the financial cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
  I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
